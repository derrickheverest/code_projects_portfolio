Project finished: June 2011


The file, pathfinder.h was my contribution to the project.  It was an
algorithm that would help the enemies chase you properly.  The dungeon
is a maze and if you happen to run super far away from it, the monster
should still be able to track you down pretty fast (thanks to the 
pathfinder algorithm, AKA A-star search)

The zip file is the completed game.  If you have windows xp you can play it.
