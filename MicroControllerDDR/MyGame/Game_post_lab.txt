We were allowed to use any hardware components as long as we used it with the micro controller.  We were free to choose any game.  We chose to do a Guitar hero like game.Personal contributions	I did most of the programming.  I put together the hardware so that the LED matrix and the LCD would interact with the micro controller.  I designed the game logic such that the music would play when the correct button sequence was entered.  I organized the task manager.  I drew state machines and block diagrams.  I wrote a program to play specific sounds.  I wrote a driver for the LED matrix so that it could show the desired image.Skills learned and Knowledge gained	I learned how to look on the web for information about parts and to search for its data sheets.  I learned that sometimes there isn’t going to be a data sheet and you will have to use guess and check.  I had to do guess and check on the LED matrix.  I learned that the micro controller has a external reset button which saves the hassle of trying to reset within code.  I learned that jitter can mess up synchronous ticks that are interdependent of each other and that if you can make things less dependent on each other it makes everything simpler.
